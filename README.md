# CodeClauseInternship_Live-language-Translation
The "Live Language Translation" project aims to create a web application that facilitates real-time language translation between different languages
 This project will primarily utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a user-friendly and interactive interface.

 Users will be able to input text in one language, select their desired target language, and instantly receive translated text. The translation will be dynamic, allowing for continuous updates as the user modifies the input text. To achieve this, the project will integrate translation APIs or libraries, such as Google Translate or Microsoft Translator.

The user interface will feature a clean and intuitive design using HTML and CSS, ensuring accessibility and responsiveness across various devices. JavaScript will be responsible for handling user input, triggering translations, and updating the display in real time.

Ultimately, this project aims to break down language barriers, fostering communication and understanding between people who speak different languages, making it a valuable tool for international collaboration and communication.
